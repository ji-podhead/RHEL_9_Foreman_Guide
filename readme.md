# Foreman 3.10 + Puppet + Katello + Discovery Plugin-Installation- &  PXE Beginners Guide for RHEL_9 (using local-DHCP&TFTP)
 
 In this Guide i will show you how to install Forman with puppet, katello and discovery plugin.
 You will also learn how to install and setup DHCP- and TFTP-Server.
 I will also show you how to setup Foreman and how to use the Foreman Boot Image via PXE.
You will be ready to discover and provision your physical servers and workstations after following this Guide.
> ***before we start:***
>  - foreman comes without its own dhcp/tftp unlike MAAS, Tinkerbell, etc
>    - you either need to have external dhcp, or you need to install the servers locally
>  - we will install and we will use Foreman on a single node ***without external DHCP***
>  -  we wont use  ***Smartproxy DNS*** since its not required if using a local DHCP 
>-  we install Discovery Plugin before setting up TFTP because we have less work
> - Its demanded that you install Foreman with Katello on a ***freshly provisioned machine***
	>  	- you cannot install katello plugin if you installed foreman without it before
> -  make sure that you have a ***Backup*** before using the Installer
>    - *especially if you have set up Foreman successfully before*
>    - you can make backup by using:
>       - img (dd, gparted)
>       - rsync (standalone, or better: ***rsnapshot***)
> - we use `Rocky Linux 9.4` in this example

### DNS
- [do routers have dns?](https://superuser.com/questions/1715361/do-routers-have-a-dns-server)
... 
> most SOHO routers have a built-in DNS server to act as a cache. It's not a mandatory "router" feature though â€“ enterprise networks would run their DNS on a separate system instead.
>  **If this is so, then I guess that DNS server would just be another cache similar to the one in Windows...or is it a more advanced DNS server?**
> - It varies between products. Talking about SOHO routers, the router's own DNS server is pretty much always just a caching proxy and actual name resolution relies on forwarding requests to an upstream resolver; no root hints involved.
> - But in addition to that, it is also quite common for the router to be authoritative for some "local" domain (like .lan or .home or .dlink) which contains hostnames for your LAN hosts. This integrates with the router's DHCP service, collecting hostnames that devices provide in their lease requests. It may even support static entries, though in SOHO routers it's rarely anything more than a single 'A' record per name.
- why does foreman require dns?
> - To provision with Foreman, the DNS domain of the router is essential because Foreman requires defined domain names for every host in the network. These domain names are crucial for managing A-, AAAA-, and PTR resource records. Even if Foreman doesn't manage your DNS servers, you still need to create at least one domain and assign it. Domains are part of the naming conventions that Foreman uses for hosts, for example, a host named test123 in the example.com domain has the fully qualified domain name test123.example.com.
> - During the DNS record creation process, Foreman performs conflict DNS answers to ensure that the hostname is not actively being used. This check is performed against one of the following DNS servers:
>  	- The system-wide resolver, if under Administer > Settings > Query local nameservers the option true is enabled.
>  	- The nameservers defined in the subnet agreement with the host.
>  	- The authoritative NS-records derived from the SOA (Start of Authority) of the domain name associated with the host.
> - Therefore, knowing the domain name of the router is crucial for successful provisioning with Foreman to ensure that all DNS queries are handled correctly and no conflicts arise. This is particularly important when Foreman attempts to dynamically assign IP addresses or checks existing DNS entries to ensure that no IP addresses are duplicated.

    Note over PC: Boot process begins
    PC->>+VLAN: Sends DHCPDISCOVER
    VLAN->>-PC: Redirects DHCPDISCOVER to DHCP
    PC->>+DHCP: Sends DHCPREQUEST
    DHCP->>-PC: Sends DHCPOFFER with IP, Gateway, DNS Server (DNSRouter), and Subnet Mask
    Note over DNSRouter: PC configures DNS settings based on DHCP offer
    PC->>+HostsFile: Reads Hosts File for custom mappings
    HostsFile-->>-PC: Returns mapped IP addresses if available
    Note over PC: PC uses DNSRouter for standard lookups within local network
    PC->>+ExternalDNS: Sends DNS queries for domain names outside local network
    ExternalDNS->>-PC: Sends answers with IP addresses
    Note over PC: PC uses Hosts File for custom mappings
    PC->>+Storage: Stores network configuration (IP, Gateway, DNS)
    Storage-->>-PC: Confirms storage
    Note over PC: PC is now fully configured and connected



```




### PXE and TFTP
> This diagram outlines the basic steps involved in the PXE and TFTP boot process:
> - Client Starts Booting: The client device initiates the boot process.
> - Sends DHCPDISCOVER: The client sends a DHCPDISCOVER packet to discover available DHCP servers.
> - Receives DHCPOFFER: The DHCP server responds with a DHCPOFFER packet, providing the client with an IP address and the address of the TFTP server.
> - Requests Boot Image: The client requests the boot image from the TFTP server.
> - Sends Boot Image: The TFTP server sends the boot image to the client.
> - Executes Boot Image: The client executes the boot image, initiating the boot process from the network.

## Preperation

- make sure you have a static hostname (we will use `my_hostname`)

***switch to root  because its easier:***
``` Bash
$ su root
```

***get your  NIC's IP and Name:***
```Bash
# ifconfig
```

>```
> enp2s0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
>       inet 192.168.2.100  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.2.255
>```.

> - my NIC is enp2s0 and my IP is 129.168.2.100:


***find your NIC's DNS-Server's IP and Domain***
- we  need this for the hosts mapping
- The Domain of your Router should be printed on it, or it was given by your switch, vlan (vlan-routing), etc...
- , but we can also find it out via console:
	- we find the connected DNS IP and ask the server for its Domain-name using `nslookup`
		- you can also use `dig`  instead of nslookup
 ```Bash
 # nmcli device show enp2s0 | grep IP4.DNS
 ```
> ```
> # 									DNS-Server-IP:
> IP4.DNS[1]:                             192.168.2.1
> ```
```Bash
# nslookup 192.168.2.1
 ```
>```
> 1.2.168.192.in-addr.arpa	name = speedport.ip.
> ```
- you can also check in the `/etc/resolv.conf`
	- this is set by NetworkManager and the dhcp of your router 
>```
> # Generated by NetworkManager
> search speedport.ip
> nameserver 192.168.2.1
> nameserver fe80::1%enp2s0
>```
***edit the hosts file***
 
- edit `/etc/hosts`
	-  the Domain for the host mapping should  be:
		-  <host name+routers domain>
```
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6

192.168.2.100 my_hostname.speedport.ip
```
***firewall settings:***
```Bash
# firewall-cmd --add-port="5646/tcp"
```
```Bash
# firewall-cmd \
--add-port="5647/tcp" \
--add-port="8000/tcp" \
--add-port="9090/tcp"
```
```Bash
# firewall-cmd \
--add-service=dns \
--add-service=dhcp \
--add-service=tftp \
--add-service=http \
--add-service=https \
--add-service=puppetmaster
```
```Bash
# firewall-cmd --runtime-to-permanent
```
 > ***>> check if it works <<***
 >  ```Bash
 >  # firewall-cmd --list-all
 >  ```
 >  ```markdown
 >...
 >  interfaces: enp2s0
 >  sources: 
 >  services: cockpit dhcp dhcpv6-client dns http https mdns puppetmaster ssh tftp
 >  ports: 5646/tcp 5647/tcp 8000/tcp 9090/tcp
 >...

## Install
***get the repos***
```Bash
# dnf install https://yum.theforeman.org/releases/3.10/el9/x86_64/foreman-release.rpm
# dnf install https://yum.theforeman.org/katello/4.12/katello/el9/x86_64/katello-repos-latest.rpm
# dnf install https://yum.puppet.com/puppet7-release-el-9.noarch.rpm
```





***install  foreman 3.10 with katello plugin***
```Bash
# dnf update
# dnf install foreman-installer-katello
# foreman-installer --scenario katello
```
```
...
  Success!
  * Foreman is running at https://my_hostname.speedport.ip
      Initial credentials are admin / <pass>
  * To install an additional Foreman proxy on separate machine continue by running:

      foreman-proxy-certs-generate --foreman-proxy-fqdn "$FOREMAN_PROXY" --certs-tar "/root/$FOREMAN_PROXY-certs.tar.gz"
  * Foreman Proxy is running at https://my_hostname.speedport.ip:9090

The full log is at /var/log/foreman-installer/katello.log
```
---
> **we connect to foreman dashboard by using**
>```
> URL: https://my_hostname.speedport.ip
> user: admin
> pass:  <pass>`
>```

---
***install the Discovery Plugin***
```Bash
# foreman-installer --enable-foreman-plugin-discovery
```
```
...
  Success!
  * Foreman is running at https://my_hostname.speedport.ip
  * To install an additional Foreman proxy on separate machine continue by running:

      foreman-proxy-certs-generate --foreman-proxy-fqdn "$FOREMAN_PROXY" --certs-tar "/root/$FOREMAN_PROXY-certs.tar.gz"
  * Foreman Proxy is running at https://my_hostname.speedport.ip:9090

The full log is at /var/log/foreman-installer/katello.log

> ***>> check if it worked <<***
> ```Bash
> # dnf repolist enabled

---
> ****(optional)* delete old/wrong repo:***
> - edit the foreman.repo file and remove the flawed ones:
> ```Bash
> # dnf clean all
> # dnf install nano
> # sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/foreman.repo
> # sudo dnf clean all
> # sudo dnf makecache
> ```
> 
## DHCP 
***Install:***
```Bash
# dnf install dhcp-server -y
```

***Config:***
- we add a Subnet
  - we choose a Range of 100 
	  - huge Networks can be unnecessary security Risk
  - our subnetmask is `255.255.255.0`, hence our CIDR is  `24`
  
```Bash 
# sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
```


> ```Bash 
> ...
> # speedport.ip
>subnet 192.168.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
 > pool
>  {
>    range 192.168.2.101 192.168.2.200;
>  }
>  option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
>  option routers 192.168.2.100;
>}
> ```
- Now we can enable the dhcp service
	-  if this this fails you most likely have wrong subnet or firewall settings
 > ```Bash
 > # sudo systemctl enable --now dhcpd
>```

 > ****(optional)* check if dhcp server is already installed and running***
>```Bash
> # nmap -sU 127.0.0.1 -p 67
> ```
> 
>  ```markdown
>  # if  its not installed or not running:
> ...
> PORT   STATE  SERVICE
> 67/udp closed dhcps
> ...
> ```
>  ```markdown
> #  if up and running:
> ...
> PORT   STATE         SERVICE
> 67/udp open|filtered dhcps
> ...
> ```
> of course you can check systemctl as well, but  since we dont know the name of the service we   just check the port directly (DHCP is Port 67 followed by TFTP port 68)
> you can also use telnet, lsof, etc

## TFTP
***install***
```Bash
# sudo dnf install tftp-server -y
```
***check if Discovery-Plugin created the Boot-image Files:***
- there should be a `/var/lib/tftpboot/boot/fdi-image` dir that holds the  `vmlinuz` and `initrd` files
- you also need to create a config file:   `nano /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default`
   -  the **user has to be nobody** (system-user) and it should be **fully writable**
   
 ```Bash
 #  nano /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default
   ```
   
>```
> default menu.c32
> timeout 300
> label ForemanBootImage
>  menu label ^Foreman Boot Image
> kernel /path/to/your/boot/image/vmlinuz
> append initrd=/path/to/your/boot/image/initrd.img root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=:192.168.0.1:/var> > /lib/tftboot/boot ip=dhcp
> ```

```Bash
# sudo chmod -R 777 /var/lib/tftpboot
# sudo chown -R nobody: /var/lib/tftpboot
```
   - Change tftpboot dir if required:
```bash
$ nano /usr/lib/systemd/system/tftp.service
```

>```
> [Unit]
> Description=Tftp Server
> Requires=tftp.socket
> Documentation=man:in.tftpd
> [Service]
> ExecStart=/usr/sbin/in.tftpd -s /var/lib/tftpboot
> StandardInput=socket
> [Install]
> Also=tftp.socket
>```

- not sure if this was required:
  
>```Bash
> sudo nano /etc/xinetd.d/tftp
>```

>```
> service tftp
> {
> socket_type             = dgram
> protocol                = udp
> wait                    = yes
> user                    = root
> server                  = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
> server_args             = -s /var/lib/tftpboot
> disable                 = no 						# needs to be "no"
> per_source              = 11
> cps                     = 100 2
> flags                   = IPv4
> }
>```



-  tftp service can be activated by `using systemctl enable tftp` (not xintetd)!
>```Bash
> # systemctl enable tftp
>```

## Update Foreman
- we set managed dns to false: `--foreman-proxy-dns-managed false \`
```Bash
#  foreman-installer \
--foreman-proxy-dns true \
--foreman-proxy-dns-managed false \
--foreman-proxy-dhcp true \
--foreman-proxy-dhcp-managed true \
--foreman-proxy-dhcp-range "192.168.2.101 192.168.2.200" \
--foreman-proxy-dhcp-gateway 192.168.2.100 \
--foreman-proxy-dhcp-nameservers 192.168.2.100 \
--foreman-proxy-tftp true \
--foreman-proxy-tftp-managed true \
--foreman-proxy-tftp-servername 192.168.2.100
```
